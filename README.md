# Tauri + React + Typescript

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, React and Typescript in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## How to Run
Clone the repo, navigate to the root folder, then execute:
```npm run tauri dev```

## Project Description
I want to build a desktop music player that is more friendly to organizing classical music. I have large collection that I inherited from a family member, and I have not found a music player that works for me in keeping it organized and accessible.

I also am very interested in learning Rust, so using Tauri as the framework will allow me to do that along the way.
